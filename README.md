# Team-59 Adobe-Mid-Prep: Inter IIT Tech Meet 12.0

## Overview 🌟
Welcome to our project repository! Here, we've developed a suite of Python scripts tailored for robust data analysis, preprocessing, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). These scripts are meticulously organized into training, inference, and final execution stages, ensuring a seamless workflow for your data processing needs.

### Project Structure 📁
Our project consists of the following key scripts:

1. **EDA.py**: This script is your starting point for data exploration. It includes various tools for visualizing and understanding your dataset.
2. **Preprocessing.py**: Here, we've implemented cutting-edge data preprocessing techniques to prepare your data for analysis.
3. **Final_Pipeline_Training_File.py**: This script contains the comprehensive codebase for training models on two distinct tasks - Task1 and Task2.
4. **Final_Pipeline_Testing.py**: Designed for deploying the trained model, this script serves as the architecture for final model evaluation.

## Getting Started 🚀
To dive into our project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/TeamNumber59/Adobe-Inter-IIT-Tech-Meet-12.0.git
   ```
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment:
   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Install Dependencies:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Initiate Training:
   ```shell
   python3 Final_Pipeline_Training_File.py
   ```
5. Execute the Testing Script:
   ```shell
   python3 Final_Pipeline_Testing.py
   ```

## Usage Guide 🛠️
- **EDA.py**: Load your dataset to commence exploratory data analysis. Utilize the script to uncover key trends and distribution patterns.
- **Preprocessing.py**: Employ this script to refine your data, managing any missing values and standardizing features.
- **Final_Pipeline_Training_File**: Use this for model training tailored to your dataset and specified tasks.
- **Final_Pipeline_Testing.py**: This is your go-to script for model testing and evaluation.
